<summary><h2>Git and GitHub</h2></summary>

Today (2024-09-14) I learned about some basic Git command and about GitHub.

### Git
- clone
Clones a working repository using an HTTPS link
- add
Preps file changes to be commited
- commit
Preps all added file changes with a comment
- push
Pushes all commited file changes to the online repository
- fetch
Gets the latest information about the changes on GitHub
- status
Displays the differences between the clone and the repo
- pull
Pulls current main repo with all its changes

### GitHub
An online location to host repositories to be able to access them in one place and to access other people's repositories.

You can ssh into your server using the format:
```sh
âžœ  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
```

The public ip address for my server is currently: 35.170.208.120

<summary><h2>HTML Structure</h2></summary>

### Purpose of HTML
HTML serves two main purposes:
1. Provide structure
2. Provide content

### Common HTML Structural Elements
There are several common structural elements, including:

- body, header, footer, main
- section ~ Used to compartmentalize sections
- aside ~ A different way to compartmentalize a section
- p (paragraph) ~ Used for unanchored text
- table ~ Used for building a table
- ol/ul (ordered/unordered lists) ~ The two ways to make lists
- div ~ Yet another way to compartmentalize a section that doen't span the length of the screen
- span ~ A section that spans the length of the screen

### Document Structure
These elements are typically used to structure an HTML document:

- The **body** is the top-level content container.
- The body usually has three main children: **header**, **main**, and **footer**.
- Each of these children contains other structural content:
  - The **header** often includes a paragraph with a span and navigation with divisions.
  - The **main** section typically contains multiple sections with lists or tables, and may include an aside for content that doesn't fit the main flow.
  - The **footer** usually has a content division, often with a span.

### Importance of Proper Structure
Using the correct structural elements is crucial for:
1. Logical organization for programmers
2. Proper interpretation by automated tools like search indexing crawlers
3. Accessibility for screen readers

### Block vs. Inline Elements
There is a distinction between block and inline elements:

- **Block elements** create distinct blocks in the content flow (e.g., div, p).
- **Inline elements** fit within the content flow of block elements without disrupting it (e.g., b, span).
