<summary><h2>Git and GitHub</h2></summary>

Today (2024-09-14) I learned about some basic Git command and about GitHub.

### Git
- clone
Clones a working repository using an HTTPS link
- add
Preps file changes to be commited
- commit
Preps all added file changes with a comment
- push
Pushes all commited file changes to the online repository
- fetch
Gets the latest information about the changes on GitHub
- status
Displays the differences between the clone and the repo
- pull
Pulls current main repo with all its changes

### GitHub
An online location to host repositories to be able to access them in one place and to access other people's repositories.

You can ssh into your server using the format:
```sh
âžœ  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
```

The public ip address for my server is currently: 35.170.208.120

<summary><h2>HTML Structure</h2></summary>

### Purpose of HTML
HTML serves two main purposes:
1. Provide structure
2. Provide content

### Common HTML Structural Elements
There are several common structural elements, including:

- body, header, footer, main
- section ~ Used to compartmentalize sections
- aside ~ A different way to compartmentalize a section
- p (paragraph) ~ Used for unanchored text
- table ~ Used for building a table
- ol/ul (ordered/unordered lists) ~ The two ways to make lists
- div ~ Yet another way to compartmentalize a section that doen't span the length of the screen
- span ~ A section that spans the length of the screen

### Document Structure
These elements are typically used to structure an HTML document:

- The **body** is the top-level content container.
- The body usually has three main children: **header**, **main**, and **footer**.
- Each of these children contains other structural content:
  - The **header** often includes a paragraph with a span and navigation with divisions.
  - The **main** section typically contains multiple sections with lists or tables, and may include an aside for content that doesn't fit the main flow.
  - The **footer** usually has a content division, often with a span.

### Importance of Proper Structure
Using the correct structural elements is crucial for:
1. Logical organization for programmers
2. Proper interpretation by automated tools like search indexing crawlers
3. Accessibility for screen readers

### Block vs. Inline Elements
There is a distinction between block and inline elements:

- **Block elements** create distinct blocks in the content flow (e.g., div, p).
- **Inline elements** fit within the content flow of block elements without disrupting it (e.g., b, span).

<summary><h2>HTML Input</h2></summary>

---

This section discussed HTML input elements and their importance in web forms.

### Purpose of Input Elements
Input elements are useful for creating interactive web applications, allowing users to provide data that can be processed and stored.

### Common Input Elements
The document lists several input elements, including:

text, password, email, number, tel, url, date, datetime-local, month, week, time, color, file, checkbox, radio, range, reset, submit, etc...

### Input Attributes
Important attributes for input elements are discussed:

- **name**: Identifies the input when submitting to a server
- **value**: Specifies the current value of the input
- **required**: Indicates if the input must have a value
- **placeholder**: Provides an example of what to enter
- **autocomplete**: Suggests previous values as the user types
- **autofocus**: Automatically focuses the input on page load
- **spellcheck**: Enables spell checking for text

### Form Element
Input elements are typically wrapped in a **form** element, which:

1. Groups related inputs
2. Enables collective submission of input values

### Label Element
The importance of the **label** element is highlighted as:

- Associating text with an input element
- Increasing usability by expanding the clickable area
- Improving accessibility for screen readers

### Output Element
The **output** element is introduced as a way to represent the result of a calculation or user action within a form.

<summary><h2>HTML Media</h2></summary>

---

This section discussed HTML media elements and their usage in web development.

### HTML Media Elements
Five main media elements were covered:
- img
- audio
- video
- svg
- canvas

### External Media
There are two ways to reference external media using URLs:

- Full paths include protocol, domain name, and file path
- Relative paths are preferred for easier code portability

#### Image Element
The `img` element is used to include images:
- Requires a `src` attribute with the image URL
- Should include an `alt` attribute for accessibility

#### Audio Element
The `audio` element is used for including audio files:
- Requires a `src` attribute with the audio file URL
- Optional attributes include `controls`, `autoplay`, and `loop`
- Autoplay is discouraged without user opt-in

#### Video Element
The `video` element is used for including videos:
- Requires a `src` attribute with the video file URL
- Can include `controls` and `autoplay` attributes
- May need `crossorigin="anonymous"` for files from different domains

### Internal Media
The section discussed two elements for creating images within HTML:

#### SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- Allows inline creation of graphics in HTML
- Can be combined with JavaScript and CSS for complex visualizations

#### Canvas
- Introduced for 2D drawing and animation
- Requires JavaScript for actual drawing on the canvas
