## Git and GitHub
Today (2024-09-14) I learned about some basic Git command and about GitHub.

### Git
- clone
Clones a working repository using an HTTPS link
- add
Preps file changes to be commited
- commit
Preps all added file changes with a comment
- push
Pushes all commited file changes to the online repository
- fetch
Gets the latest information about the changes on GitHub
- status
Displays the differences between the clone and the repo
- pull
Pulls current main repo with all its changes

### GitHub
An online location to host repositories to be able to access them in one place and to access other people's repositories.

## Amazon Web Services - EC2
You can ssh into your server using the format:
```sh
âžœ  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
```

The public ip address for my server is currently: 35.170.208.120
